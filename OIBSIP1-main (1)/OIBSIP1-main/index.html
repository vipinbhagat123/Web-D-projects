          <h2>India's first female teacher</h2>
          <p>
            <b>         Savitribai Phule was an Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra. 
                Along with her husband, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule in Maharashtra, she played an important and vital role in improving women's rights in India. 
                She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist movement. Savitribai and her husband founded one of the early modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhide wada in 1848. 
                Robert May of the London Missionary Society was the first person to open a school exclusively for girls[3] in the region of Chinsurah, Bengal, in 1818.
                She worked to abolish the discrimination and unfair treatment of people based on caste and gender.

          <h1><u>Her education</u></h1>

          
          <p>
                      Savitribai was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Jyotirao educated Savitribai and Sagunabai Shirsagar, his cousin sister at their home along with working at their farm.
             After completing her primary education with Jyotirao, her further education was the responsibility of his friends, Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar.
             She also enrolled herself in two teacher's training programs; the first was at institution run by an American missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar, and the second course was at a Normal School in Pune.
             Given her training, Savitribai may have been the first Indian woman teacher and headmistress.

          <h1><u>Career</u></h1>
          

          <p>
            Savitribai Phule began instructing girls at the Maharwada in Pune after completing her teacher training.
            She did this with the help of Jyotirao’s tutor and revolutionary feminist Sagunabai Kshirsagar.
            Soon after starting to work as Sagunabai’s assistants, Savitribai, Jyotirao Phule, and Sagunabai opened their own school in Bhide Wada.
            Tatya Saheb Bhide, who lived in Bhide Wada, was motivated by the job the trio was doing. Math, physics, and social studies were all part of the traditional western curriculum at Bhide Wada.
            Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were in charge of three different ladies’ schools in Pune by the end of 1851.
            There were roughly 150 students enrolled among the three institutions.The three schools used different teaching strategies from those used in government schools, much like the curriculum did.
            According to the author, Divya Kandukuri, the Phule methods were thought to be better to those employed by government institutions.
            Because to this reputation, more girls attended the Phule schools than boys did, compared to the number of boys enrolled in public schools... Read more at: https://currentaffairs.adda247.com/savitribai-phule-biography/

          <h1><u>Personal life</u></h1>
          <p>
                Savitribai and Jyotirao had no children of their own. It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. 
                However, there is no original evidence available yet to support this.[9] It is said when Yashwant was about to get married, no one was willing to give him a girl because he was born to a widow. 
                Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization's worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February 1889.
